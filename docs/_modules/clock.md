This clock module is inspired of the [ALM001 / Pamela's Workout](http://busycircuits.com/alm001/).  
Clock provides 12 clocks synchronized each other. You can change for each output the clock divisor / multiplier, game time, and output voltage.  
I'm thinking to add more parameters such as delay, swing, mode (odd/even filter ?, repeat ?, euclidian ? ...).  
Also I want the only knob be an infinity knob as the Pamela's Workout.  
  
Currently, using this module can be tedious. It's long to change and select the right parameter. The real Pamela's workout use the know to select
the edited parameter, seem to be a good solution.

- BPM based clock (1 - 300 BPM)
- Frequency based clock (0.01 - 20Hz)
- Per output features:
  - gate time
  - divisor and multiplier
  - output voltage

This module is still in preview and can be buggy and may be changed or improved.
